<h2 id="impression">Impression</h2>

<p>Top 5 mostly used words to describe me:</p>

<p><strong>encyclopedic, communicative, self-motivated, sanguine, considerate</strong></p>

<p>My ambition is to understand, to care about and to change the world and the people, by technology and by other ways.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-does-the-subheading-aiya-eärendil-elenion-ancalima-mean">What does the subheading &ldquo;Aiya Eärendil elenion ancalima!&rdquo; mean?</h2>

<p><em>Eureka</em>! You noticed it!</p>

<p>It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya">Quenya</a> sentence from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>&rsquo;s great works. In English, it means <strong>&ldquo;Hail Eärendil brightest of the stars!&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Eärendil, which is a hero in the story and then became the brightest star on the sky, always directs people in hard way. You can refer <a href="https://www.jrrvf.com/glaemscrafu/english/aiyaearendil.html">here</a> for more.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of Tolkien. I especially love his work <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></strong>. He is not only a great writer, but also a great linguist, which encourage me to kindle the interest in linguistics.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>

<p>I love languages. I would like to study and grasp many languages.</p>

<p>I can speak Mandarin, English and Japanese (learning).</p>

<p>I am very good at reading and writing Classical Chinese (文言文).</p>

<p>I also love to study dialects and accents. I can tell many Chinese dialects and judge someone&rsquo;s origin from his or her accent, sometimes precise to county. It is very hard in Chinese.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="football-translation">Football &amp; Translation</h2>

<p>I love watching football (soccer) matches. I also love translation. Combining them, my friends and I operate a popular column - <em>&ldquo;Football Megaphone&rdquo;</em> , on the world&rsquo;s largest Chinese sports forum <a href="https://www.hupu.com">Hupu</a>. We translate and introduce poplular Reddit discussions about football to Chinese fans.</p>

<p>We are proud that our column is officially certificated as &ldquo;gold medal&rdquo; and always got sticking on the top, and that our work received a lot of praise.</p>

<p>We also have a WeChat official account, which has 4300+ subscribers.</p>

<p>Our column: <a href="https://my.hupu.com/26351723465132/topic"><em>Football Megaphone</em></a></p>

<p>WeChat official account:</p>

<h2 id="classical-music-orchestra">Classical Music &amp; Orchestra</h2>

<p>I love classical music, especially Brahms, Schubert and Mendelssohn.</p>

<p>I can play piano, marimba, xylophone and several percussion instruments.</p>

<p>I used to be the <em>Principle of Percussion</em> in ShanghaiTech Orchestra.</p>

<p>You can see our photos after concert on the right.</p>

<h2 id="other-hobbies">Other Hobbies</h2>

<p><strong>History:</strong></p>

<p>Especially Chinese history in Southern Dynasities (南朝) and Middle Late Tang Dynasty (中晚唐).</p>

<p>Several people I revere the most: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Deyu">Li Deyu</a>(<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/李德裕">李德裕</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Jian_(Southern_Qi)">Wand Jian</a>(<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/王儉_(南朝)">王俭</a>),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Juzheng">Zhang Juzheng</a>(<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/張居正">张居正</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Astronomy:</strong></p>

<p>I love astronomical observation from very young, and paid several trips. I had study in Ancient Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_constellations">Astronomy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar">Calenderic System</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Meteorology:</strong></p>

<p>I pay attention to meteorology data everyday and discuss actively with other lovers. I study in tropical cyclones specially.</p>

<p><strong>Geography &amp; Cartography:</strong></p>

<p>I am very familiar with world geography, and have a large collection of maps and atlas. I can draw maps of many places merely by memory.</p>

<p><strong>Sports:</strong></p>

<p>I like most sports, except for long distance running (it&rsquo;s horrible!!!). I love hiking and city walk in particular.</p>

<p><strong>Travelling:</strong></p>

<p>I just can&rsquo;t stop exploring. If travelling in city, I try to inspect its history, economy layout and plan of development. If in nature, I try to explore those rarely reached and find special experience.</p>

<p>I usually know about a place very well once I have been there. You can ask me for advice before travelling to someplace.</p>

<p><em>Fun fact:</em> I have a good sense of direction and space. I rarely get lost. Once I have been somewhere, I always know which direction I am facing and can draw the layout of the space I was in after leaving.</p>

<p><strong>Literature:</strong></p>

<p>I can recite a lot of ancient Chinese literature works. But I also read and love many world classic literatures, European, American, Japanese and Latin American. Sometimes I write novels, short stories and fairy tales.</p>
