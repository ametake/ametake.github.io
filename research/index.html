<p>Microsoft Research, Sept. 2019 - Present</p>

<p><em>Advisor: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yincao/">Ying Cao</a></em></p>

<p>This research is for a long-term prospective to build a next generation system-friendly machine learning system. Nowadays, machine learning research usually focus on performance without considering the cost. However, either large-scale computation or realistic small scale tasks benefits from the reduce of the cost. There are two ways: choosing the appropriate method, and optimizing the code. Both of the two ways need deep understanding of the methods.</p>

<p>In this research, we are designing, executing and analyzing experiments to study respective merits of recurrent neural networks compared with the transformer. We try to find the costs of them when reaching the same performance in various circumstances and tasks, in order to investigate the reasons behind the results and the merits of RNNs in some scope, and use the discoveries to help further study.</p>

<p>ShanghaiTech University, Jan. 2019 - July 2019</p>

<p><em>Advisor: <a href="http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/">Prof. Kewei Tu</a></em></p>

<p>Structured prediction is a kind of tasks which predict structured output such as text sequence and images. In traditional methods meet chanllenges to calculate partition function. Besides, in realistic circumstances, labeled data are usually manually made and thus hard to obtain. Therefore, there is a wide demand and practival significance of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. We are developing a model based on Structured Prediction Energy Networks (SPEN) to solve the computing difficulty while taking relations of labels into consideration and using SGD approximation as a feasible way to solve optimization problems.</p>

<p>ShanghaiTech University, Mar. 2019 - June 2019</p>

<p><em>Advisor: <a href="http://dengji-zhao.net">Prof. Dengji Zhao</a></em></p>

<p>Film industry has become one of the most valuable entertainment industries and is still expanding rapidly under the fast development of mobile internet network and time of popular culture. However, the current fixed price pricing strategy has great limitation that block the growth of movies’ both profit and social effect. We brought out a new pricing model, considering the complex realistic features of film industry, introducing the &ldquo;Pay As You Wish&rdquo;(PWYW) strategy into film pricing. Through both theoretical analysis and random simulation, our model is proved to have better performance than common model in current market.</p>
