<p>Microsoft Research, Sept. 2019 - Present</p>

<p><em>Advisor: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yincao/">Ying Cao</a></em></p>

<p>In long-term prospective, we are working together to build a next generation machine learning system that is designed in the view of system research and friendly to system, which focus on code and compiling level optimization rather than performance without considering cost. This can be reached by solving numerous sub-tasks.</p>

<p>Currently, we are designing, executing and analyzing experiments to study merits of recurrent neural networks compared with the transformer in specific scopes on tasks such as Language Model, in order to investigate the reasons behind the results and use the discoveries to help further study.</p>

<p>ShanghaiTech University, Jan. 2019 - July 2019</p>

<p><em>Advisor: <a href="http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/">Prof. Kewei Tu</a></em></p>

<p>This project is concerned with prediction tasks such as dependency parsing and multi-label classification in natural language processing, with limited information, for example, unannotated data offered. In these area, previous methods found it hard in regularization and probability calculation in specific circumstances. We proposed a model based on Structured Prediction Energy Networks. It focused on general evaluation instead of probabilities, taking sentence structures into consideration.</p>

<p>ShanghaiTech University, Mar. 2019 - June 2019</p>

<p><em>Advisor: <a href="http://dengji-zhao.net">Prof. Dengji Zhao</a></em></p>

<p>Film industry has become one of the most valuable entertainment industries and is still expanding rapidly under the fast development of mobile internet network and time of popular culture. However, the current fixed price pricing strategy has great limitation that block the growth of movies’ both profit and social effect. We brought out a new pricing model, considering the complex realistic features of film industry, introducing the &ldquo;Pay As You Wish&rdquo;(PWYW) strategy into film pricing. Through both theoretical analysis and random simulation, our model is proved to have better performance than common model in current market.</p>
